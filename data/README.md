# OCR Results Directory

This directory contains the results of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing of recipe images.

## Directory Structure

```
data/ocr-results/
├── raw/          # Raw OCR text extracted from images
├── processed/    # Structured JSON recipe data
└── logs/         # Processing and validation logs
```

## Files

### Raw OCR Text (`raw/`)
- Contains `.txt` files with the original text extracted by Tesseract
- Filenames correspond to the original image names (e.g., `naan.txt` for `naan.jpg`)
- Also includes preprocessed images used for OCR

### Processed Recipes (`processed/`)
- Contains `.json` files with structured recipe data
- Each file follows the `Recipe` interface from `lib/types.ts`
- Ready to be integrated into the application

### Logs (`logs/`)
- `extraction.log` - Detailed log of OCR extraction process
- `batch-summary.json` - Summary of batch processing results
- `validation-report.json` - Validation results for all processed recipes

## Usage

These files are automatically generated by the OCR scripts. Do not edit manually unless necessary.

To regenerate:
```bash
npm run ocr:extract   # Process single or all images
npm run ocr:validate  # Validate processed recipes
```

## Note

This directory is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`). Results are stored as workflow artifacts in GitHub Actions.
